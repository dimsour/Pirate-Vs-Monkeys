Hey there!!

This is My 3rd pack and it's composed by five 8-bit music loops that was inspired by classic 8 bit games.
There is a Factory Stage song, a Mine Stage song, a Sky Stage song, a Dungeon Stage song and a Last Stage song.
You can just rename it for your use... I gave those names because... they sound like the respective theme to me :p

They are all loopable.
The Dungeon Stage, I broke in the intro and the Melody, so you can just loop them together inside your game.

I hope you enjoy it!

Please, give feedback on those and if you have requests, just contact me at m_nosoline@yahoo.com.br
